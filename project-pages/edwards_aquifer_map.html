          <div class="body-text">In this project, I wanted to track landscape changes in the Edwards Aquifer Recharge Zone, an environmentally sensitive area near San Antonio that has seen significant urban development in recent decades. I started this project by acquiring imagery of the study area captured by the USGS's Landsat 7 satellite from the years 2000 and 2020. Because of the failure of the scan line corrector on Landsat 7 in 2003, my 2020 image had significant striping (areas with no data) that would need to be corrected before proceeding.</div>
          <div class="body-text">I was able to use ERDAS Imagine to destripe my 2020 image using the Layer Stack tool (which allows users to combine multiple layers into a single multispectral image) to fill in the gaps using data from 2019. From there, I performed supervised classification on both images and brought them into ArcMap to complete my analysis, which showed that approximately 11% of the area - about 6.5 square miles - had been converted from permeable to impermeable cover in the period from 2000 to 2020.</div>
