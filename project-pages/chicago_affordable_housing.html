          <div class="body-text">The goal of this project was to create a comprehensive resource for those either looking for affordable housing or looking to develop affordable housing within Chicago. To do this, I gathered data about existing affordable housing sites as well as extensive information regarding development incentives available for builders who include affordable housing in new developments. I then used various Python and GeoJSON tools to bring my data into a leaflet map for easy web integration.</div>
          <div class="body-text">After gathering data from various sources regarding different development incentives, I created an overlay with the city zoning map, binding the data to each land parcel within my map. From this, those interested in affordable housing development can click on any parcel in the city and see what development incentives exist at that site. I also gathered quality of life data (transit access, school locations, park locations etc.) and included said data in a popup window for each existing affordable housing site.</div>
