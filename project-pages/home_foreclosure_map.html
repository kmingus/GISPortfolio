          <div class="body-text">In this project, I attempted to determine if a causal relationship existed between home foreclosure rates and school quality. I identified two areas in the Chicago suburbs where school quality differed greatly from adjoining areas. I theorized that since in these areas moving a few blocks would have a significant impact on educational outcomes that some families might stretch their budget to live in the better school district, causing more foreclosures in those areas.</div>
          <div class="body-text">I started by sourcing lists of recent home forclosures in my study area. From there, I built a model in ArcGIS to convert my data into suitable a suitable format for analysis, than to perform said analyses, primarily Hot Spot Analysis and Morans I Spatial Autocorrelation. The results of this analysis were somewhat inconclusive, and did not support my hypothesis, with the strongest indicator of foreclosure rates among the data I analyzed being low median household income.</div>
